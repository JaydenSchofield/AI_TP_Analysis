It has gotten a bit better m this season (I’ve tried to use bunjees, equipment, different sprints etc) but ultimately I still don’t have the necessary speed which is required especially at the start of a race which is why I always have to catch up / swim myself up. I just find it really difficult and cannot seem to swim any faster at the moment. Also for example I know that had I done the 50s max off 60 instead of 90 I would have still gotten the same and the same for the 100s if I would have gone off a slower time than 1.30 I would still have gotten the same times.
